      <h2>For my lovely Mummy Papa,</h2>
      <p class="message-text">
        Happy 25 Silver Jubilee
      </p>
      <p class="message-text">
       Hellooooooo,
thank you guys for showing what true love looks like in this generation. These 25 years are not just a number, but a collection of countless memories, sacrifices, smiles, and shared dreams.

The way you both love each other… the small sacrifices for each other… the way you take care of each other…

Like a few months before, when Mummy fell from the staircase (Auran Ba home). Papa, that time you were not here. The next minute I told you, you replied normally, not too emotional—but I knew you cared a lot. From the very next moment, you started searching for a return ticket to come back and take care of your wife. You don’t show or say much, but the way you care for Mummy and for us is something we want to learn from.
      </p>
      <p class="message-text signature">
        And from Mummy—she is the same. She shows a little more emotion, but whenever Papa feels even a little unwell, the way she takes care of him every moment… making good food, doing all the work alone… I have no words to describe the way you both love each other.
        With lots of love,<br />
        Vansh Parikh ❤️
